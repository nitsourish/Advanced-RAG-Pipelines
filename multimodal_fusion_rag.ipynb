    "# Multimodal Fusion Retrieval: Combining Multimodal Vector-store and Keyword Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement a fusion retrieval system that combines the strengths of both\n",
    "\n",
    "**A) semantic vector search - Enhanced with multimodal context retrieval(retrieval based on both text and images)** \n",
    "\n",
    "**B) keyword-based BM25 retrieval.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach improves retrieval quality by capturing both conceptual similarity and exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Fusion Retrieval Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) typically rely on vector search alone mostly based on texts, but this has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector search may miss the essential relevant information from images \n",
    "- Vector search excels at semantic similarity but may miss exact keyword matches\n",
    "- Keyword search is great for specific terms but lacks semantic understanding\n",
    "- Different queries perform better with different retrieval methods - may both rely on texts and images or in combination with keyword matches\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal Fusion retrieval gives us the best of both worlds by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performing both vector-based and keyword-based retrieval\n",
    "- Enhances retrieval quality by augmenting with image captions \n",
    "- Normalizing the scores from each approach\n",
    "- Combining them with a weighted formula\n",
    "- Ranking documents based on the combined score"
